# Convolutional Neural Network Architecture

This code defines a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using PyTorch's `nn.Module`. The network is designed for image classification tasks and includes the following key components:

## Dropout Value
- A dropout value of `0.1` is used throughout the network to reduce overfitting by randomly dropping out units during training.

## Input Block
- The input block consists of a 2D convolutional layer with 16 output channels, followed by a ReLU activation, batch normalization, and dropout. The kernel size is `(3, 3)`.

## Convolution Block 1
- This block contains a 2D convolutional layer with 32 output channels, followed by a ReLU activation, batch normalization, and dropout. The kernel size is `(3, 3)`.

## Transition Block 1
- A transition block with a 2D convolutional layer that reduces the number of channels from 32 to 10. The kernel size is `(1, 1)`.
- Followed by a max pooling layer with a `(2, 2)` window to reduce the spatial dimensions.

## Convolution Block 2
- This block includes three sequential 2D convolutional layers, each with 16 output channels, ReLU activation, batch normalization, and dropout. The kernel sizes are `(3, 3)`.

## Output Block
- An average pooling layer with a `(6, 6)` window is used to reduce the spatial dimensions to `(1, 1)`.
- The final layer is a 2D convolutional layer with 10 output channels, corresponding to the number of classes in the classification task. The kernel size is `(1, 1)`.

## Forward Pass
- The `forward` method defines the forward pass of the network, applying each layer sequentially and using a log softmax function for the final output.

This architecture is suitable for small to medium-sized image classification tasks. The use of batch normalization and dropout helps to improve the generalization of the model.
